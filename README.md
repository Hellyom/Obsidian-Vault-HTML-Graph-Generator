# Obsidian-Vault-HTML-Graph-Generator

## Important Information

**Current Limitations**: At present, the graph only supports Obsidian's graph view #tag filters and colors. Any other filters set in Obsidian's graph view will be ignored. This tool only generates the graph view; note contents will not be accessible from the graph.

This tool is ideal for both tech-savvy users and those who prefer a simple, executable solution.

## Notes for Developers

- **Code Quality**: "Yes, it's messy. Yes, it's only one file, but I was in a hurry. There's a better way to structure this, but who cares, right?"
- **Future Plans**: Currently, there are no plans to make this an Obsidian plugin until the tool feels complete.
